# Cribl Stream in Action Syslog to S3 Elasticsearch

🚀 Cribl Stream in Action: Syslog to S3 & Elasticsearch! 🚀

I recently worked on a Cribl Stream project to streamline Syslog data ingestion, ensuring optimized storage and real-time analytics. This hands-on experience reinforced the power of observability pipelines in modern log management and security monitoring.


## 🔹 The Goal:
- ✅ **Collect and process Syslog data** efficiently.
- ✅ **Send logs to Amazon S3** for long-term storage.
- ✅ **Route logs to Elasticsearch** for real-time analysis and insights.

- 

## 🔹 The Implementation:
- 🔧 **Configured Syslog as a source** to ingest network device logs.
- 📤 **Set up Amazon S3 as a destination** to archive full-fidelity data.
- 📊 **Integrated Elasticsearch** for live log analysis and search.
- 🎯 **Validated the data pipeline** using Cribl Stream’s Live Data Capture.
